Delivery-related grievances typically concern issues that occur during or after the shipment of an item. Customers may report delays in receiving their package beyond the promised delivery window, or even claim that the delivery was marked as complete when the package was never received. Some report receiving the wrong item altogether, such as ordering a jacket but receiving a pair of shoes. Others experience problems with damaged packages, often due to poor handling by the delivery agent, or face issues with incomplete shipments when only part of the order is delivered. Customers often express frustration when delivery agents do not follow expected protocols, such as refusing to come to the customer's address or delivering at an unscheduled time. In some cases, packages are dropped off at the wrong location or left unattended without confirmation. Failure in order tracking systems, missed delivery calls, or continued delays even after complaints are also part of delivery grievances.

Billing grievances arise when customers feel they have been unfairly charged. This includes being charged twice for a single order, discrepancies between the checkout price and the final billed amount, or being billed for an item they never ordered. A frequent complaint is about refunds not being processed after cancellations, or promised discounts not being applied during billing. These issues often create mistrust and dissatisfaction with the platform's financial transparency.


Behavior-related grievances involve complaints about the attitude, tone, professionalism, or general demeanor of staff, delivery personnel, or customer service representatives during any stage of the customer journey. These issues can manifest as rude responses, unprofessional conduct, lack of empathy, dismissive language, or aggressive interactions that make the customer feel disrespected or undervalued. For example, if a delivery agent behaves rudely, refuses to follow reasonable instructions, or uses offensive language, the grievance should be classified under behavior issues. Similarly, if a customer service agent responds sarcastically, shows unwillingness to help, or fails to maintain polite communication, it also falls under this category. Behavior grievances differ from service quality issues in that they are centered on interpersonal interactions, not system delays or procedural problems.




Technical grievances are related to failures in the digital infrastructure that supports the service. This can include problems with the website or mobile app, such as crashes during checkout, issues with logging in or receiving OTPs, or malfunctioning tracking systems. Payment gateway errors, where transactions fail but the money is still deducted, are also common. These problems can prevent customers from completing their purchases or accessing essential features, often leading to frustration.

Each of these categories—delivery, billing, service, and technical—captures a different aspect of the user experience. The classifier must carefully consider the content and focus of a grievance to determine which category it most appropriately falls under, based on the language used and the underlying issue.
